//js Engine :- Program that executes javascript Code.



/*

                      Js Engine Ex V8 Engine
                      ======================



                      Call Stack - where our code is executed.(Execution Context)
                      Heap  - where objects are stored.(objects in momenry)







Compilation : Entire code is converted into machine code at once and written to a binary file that can be executed by acomputer.


SOURCE CODE ==========> Portable file ================> program Running.




Interpretation : Interpreter runs through the source code and execute it line by line.

                                 ======> Execution line by line.




Just In Time (JIT)Compilation : Entire code is converted into machine code at once and, then executed immediately.
